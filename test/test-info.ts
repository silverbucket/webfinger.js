🧪 WebFinger.js Test Suite

⚠️  NOTE: 'bun test' runs ALL tests including integration and browser tests.
   Some tests may fail due to network dependencies or environment issues.

✅ RECOMMENDED: Use 'bun run test' for the complete orchestrated test suite.

📋 Individual test commands:
   bun run test:unit        # Unit tests (TypeScript + JavaScript) 
   bun run test:integration # Integration tests with real servers
   bun run test:browser     # Browser environment tests
   bun run lint            # Code linting

🔧 For development, use specific test commands to avoid environment issues.
